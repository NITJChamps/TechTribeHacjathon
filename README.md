# Online Classroom

Education Field has been heavily disrupted by the pandemic and schools and colleges have been forced to hold classes online and Google Classroom has been thir goto option. Although Google Classroom has some great functionality but we feel that there are many problems associated with it they are :

* No Graphical Represenation of Statistics.
* No facility to store details like address of students.
* No facility to choose HOD among the faculty.
* No control of University/School to add a student into classroom. A student hinself/herself has to join a class leading to confusion.


All the above problem statements have been solved by us.
